Implement a function sequentialResolution that takes an array of
promises, "promises", and an array of indices "order". The promises should be
resolved in the order of the indices in the "order" array.  After each
promises is resolved push the returned value from the promise to a global array
"resolvedPromises".

If promises fails ot resolve, the function should throw an error, and no further promises
should be resolved. The error messaage should "Error Thrown" (without quotes). The functionshould not
return anything.

Each promises / uses a variable promises[i], provided in the input it resolves and returns promises[i]
if it is not equal to 0. If it is equal to 0, the function rejects and returns an "Error" (without quotes)

For example if order=[2,1,3], promises = [1,2,1] then the second promise should be resolved first followed
by the first and third promises. Here, no promise is rejected. Promises are resolved as [2,1,1].
