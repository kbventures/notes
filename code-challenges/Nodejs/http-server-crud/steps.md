# Steps for Creating Your Own Server

This guide outlines the basic steps for creating a custom web server using Node.js and its `http` module.

## 1. Create a Custom HTTP Server
Use the `http` module to create a basic HTTP server that listens to incoming requests.

## 2. Set Up Routing
Implement a routing system to match URLs and HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) with corresponding handlers.

## 3. Add Middleware
Implement a system to chain middleware functions that process the request and response before or after a route handler.

## 4. Handle Static Files
Implement static file serving with proper caching and MIME type handling.

## 5. Handle JSON and URL-encoded Requests
Add body parsers for handling different content types.

## 6. Implement Error Handling
Add robust error handling for various HTTP statuses and unexpected server issues.

## 7. Add Cookie and Session Management
Implement cookie parsing and management for session-based features.

## 8. Test and Document
Write tests and document your API to ensure it works correctly.
