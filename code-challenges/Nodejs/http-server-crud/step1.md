# Step 1: Create a Custom HTTP Server

## Basic Level

- **Install Node.js**:
  - Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system to work with the http module.

- **Create a New JavaScript File**:
  - Start by creating a new `.js` file (e.g., `server.js`) where you'll write your server code.

- **Require the http Module**:
  - At the top of your file, require the http module to gain access to Node.js's HTTP server capabilities.

- **Set Up a Basic HTTP Server**:
  - Use `http.createServer()` to create an HTTP server that listens for incoming requests.

- **Start the Server**:
  - Call the `listen()` method to start the server and have it listen on a specific port (e.g., 3000).

- **Send a Simple Response**:
  - Send a basic response back to the client (e.g., "Hello World") using `res.writeHead()` and `res.end()`.

- **Test the Server**:
  - Run your server using `node server.js` and test it in your browser by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.

## Intermediate Level

- **Handle Request Methods (GET, POST, etc.)**:
  - Add logic to check the HTTP request method (e.g., GET, POST) and respond accordingly.

- **Set Response Headers**:
  - Use `res.writeHead()` to send headers like Content-Type, Server, etc., with your responses.

- **Parse Request URL**:
  - Extract the URL of incoming requests to use it for custom logic or routing later (e.g., `req.url`).

- **Add Logging**:
  - Log incoming requests' details, such as the HTTP method and requested URL.

- **Respond Dynamically**:
  - Based on the request, send a dynamic response. For example, respond with the request method and URL.

- **Graceful Shutdown**:
  - Handle server shutdown gracefully by listening for termination signals (SIGINT) and closing the server properly.

## Advanced Level

- **Implement a Routing System**:
  - Set up basic routing to handle different paths (e.g., `/home`, `/about`) and methods (e.g., GET, POST).

- **Handle Query Parameters**:
  - Extract and parse query parameters from the request URL and use them in your response (e.g., `req.url` and `url.parse()`).

- **Serve HTML or JSON Responses**:
  - Respond with HTML or JSON content based on the requested route and method. Use `res.writeHead()` to set appropriate Content-Type headers (e.g., `text/html`, `application/json`).

- **Use Template Engines (optional)**:
  - Use template engines like EJS, Handlebars, or Pug to send dynamic HTML pages as a response.

- **Implement Request Handling for POST**:
  - Parse incoming POST request data (like form submissions or JSON payloads) using `req.on('data')` and `req.on('end')`.

- **Handle Asynchronous Requests**:
  - Ensure that the server can handle asynchronous tasks, such as reading from a database or filesystem, before sending a response.

- **Add Logging Middleware**:
  - Create custom middleware to log incoming requests, process headers, and handle responses before they are sent to the client.

- **Set Up Graceful Error Handling**:
  - Implement error handling to catch unexpected issues, sending appropriate HTTP status codes (like 404 or 500) and user-friendly messages.

- **Configure Timeout and Max Connections**:
  - Set up custom timeout and connection limits for the server to handle slow clients or resource exhaustion.
