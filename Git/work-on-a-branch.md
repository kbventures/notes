# Steps to Work on `origin/auth-service` Branch

### 1. Clone the Project (if you haven't already)

If you haven't cloned the project yet, use this command:

git clone <project-url>


This will give you a fresh copy of the repository.

### 2. Fetch All Remote Branches

After cloning the repository, fetch all branches from the remote:

git fetch --all


### 3. List All Remote Branches

To verify that the `origin/auth-service` branch exists on the remote, use this command to list all remote branches:

git branch -r


### 4. Checkout the `origin/auth-service` Branch

Once youâ€™ve confirmed that `origin/auth-service` exists, switch to it using:

git checkout auth-service


This will create a local branch `auth-service` that tracks `origin/auth-service`. If you encounter issues, try using the following explicit command:

git checkout -b auth-service origin/auth-service


This creates a local branch `auth-service` and sets it to track `origin/auth-service`.

### 5. Verify You Are on the Correct Branch

To confirm you're on the correct branch, run:

git branch -vv


This will show which remote branch your local branch is tracking.

### 6. Pull the Latest Changes

Finally, to make sure your local branch is up-to-date with the remote, run:

git pull origin auth-service


This ensures your local branch has the latest changes from the `auth-service` branch on the remote.
